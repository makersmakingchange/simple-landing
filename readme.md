#Simple-Landing
This repository is intended to test out a simple landing page for an open source DIY assistive technology design. The intention is to explore how to simplify the ability to get design files and documentation for users who may have limited experience with GitHub.

The landing page can be visited here: https://makersmakingchange.github.io/simple-landing/
